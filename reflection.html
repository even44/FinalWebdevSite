                In this essay we will look into the challenges and opportunities that we experienced when going 
                from a pupil in upper-secondary school to students at university. We will discuss how lectures, 
                social life, learning and group work have changed from these two stages of education.

            <div class="paragraph2">
            <p>
                The first thing you notice when you go from being a pupil at upper-secondary school to being a 
                student at university is that the environment is completely different. By this we mean that everything 
                from the hierarchy to social interactions are different. We are used to having one teacher covering 20 
                students with the possibility to help everyone. This is not the case at university. Now it’s one teacher 
                for possibly 300 students. The greatest challenge with this is that you are on your own, and responsible 
                for your own success. Luckily OsloMet uses teacher assistants  and lab-sessions to a great extent which 
                in turn makes it possible for us to get personal help with problems.

                In turn this makes it possible for us to get personal help with problems.
                The social life is completely different as well. In a classroom at upper-secondary school you know everyone. 
                At university it's harder to get to know your peers personally since the lectures have so many students in 
                them, pluss the fact that Corona has made it so that most of the lectures are on zoom. This was frightening 
                at first, but as you are designated into groups in the different subjects you find your own social group. 
                This combined with making friends in fadderuka, made this transition a lot easier.

                As mentioned earlier, you are on your own and make your own success. Learning in upper-secondary school is 90% 
                lectures and 10% independent work. At university, this distribution is flipped on its head. This transition was 
                overwhelming at first as we often found ourselves helpless with everything we are expected to learn. But as the 
                year progresses you learn the value of independent work. You gain a lot of experience by being on your own, it 
                also betters your self-discipline.

                Working in groups wasn’t as important in upper-secondary school as it is now. Through the year we have a handful 
                of obligatory assignments that we have to submit in groups. Working efficiently in groups is a skill you have to 
                learn. There are a lot of hurdles the group has to overcome such as communication and workflow. Through university 
                we are pushed to improve this skill and we can say with great confidence that we are way more efficient now than 
                when we started working in groups this semester.

                To summarize what's stated before, the transition from being a pupil at upper-secondary school to a student at 
                university is challenging, but with great opportunities. Since the scale and structure of the lectures are so 
                different from each other the social- and learning-environment is also very different. We also discussed how 
                independent work can be a challenge as well as an opportunity to better our own self-discipline. Lastly we 
                discussed how group work differs from when you are a pupil to when you are a student. The challenge with working 
                in groups boils down to workflow and communicating. We see that our communication-skills have improved a lot which 
                in turn have improved the workflow in our group projects.
