    <p>
        This page will be a two-part essay. In the first part we will talk about changes in technology, 
        how it affects us in our daily life, and if we approve of this change. In the second part we will 
        discuss the phrase “The person that invented the train invented the train crash”. We will give you 
        our take on this statement, and the social responsibility of innovators.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Social changes made by innovation
    </h2>

    <p>
        In this part we will discuss how transportation has affected and changed society, more specifically 
        the car’s role in these changes. Through the years the standard car has evolved to be faster and 
        more efficient. You can move through great distances in a relatively short time. This means that 
        regions and the world have gotten more interconnected compared with how the world looked 200 years 
        ago. This has made several positive possibilities, such as having the possibility to commute between 
        cities easily, which helps to increase the study and job opportunities of everyone. You can also meet 
        far more people, since you aren’t locked to your geographical local area.
    </p>

    <p>
        On the other side we can also see negative effects that the car has on society, one of these effects is accidents and security on the roads. Society 
        now must make demands on the car manufacturers. Cars in the past were equipped with solid static chassis and steel frames. Now there is a requirement for a 
        <a href="https://auto.howstuffworks.com/car-driving-safety/safety-regulatory-devices/crumple-zone.htm" alt="info about crumple zone">crumple zone</a> that will 
        absorb most of the energy in the event of a crash. This is to <a href=" https://snl.no/bilens_sikkerhetssystem" alt="security systems">protect those inside 
        the car</a> instead of the car itself.
