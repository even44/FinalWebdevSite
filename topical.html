                This page will be a two-part essay. In the first part we will talk about changes in technology, 
                how it affects us in our daily life, and if we approve of this change. In the second part we will 
                discuss the phrase “The person that invented the train invented the train crash”. We will give you 
                our take on this statement, and the social responsibility of innovators.

                In this part we will discuss how transportation has affected and changed society, more specifically 
                the car’s role in these changes. Through the years the standard car has evolved to be faster and 
                more efficient. You can move through great distances in a relatively short time. This means that 
                regions and the world have gotten more interconnected compared with how the world looked 200 years 
                ago. This has made several positive possibilities, such as having the possibility to commute between 
                cities easily, which helps to increase the study and job opportunities of everyone. You can also meet 
                far more people, since you aren’t locked to your geographical local area.

                On the other side we can also see negative effects that the car has on society, one of these effects is accidents and security on the roads. Society 
                now must make demands on the car manufacturers. Cars in the past were equipped with solid static chassis and steel frames. Now there is a requirement for a 
                <a href="https://auto.howstuffworks.com/car-driving-safety/safety-regulatory-devices/crumple-zone.htm" title="Info about crumple zone">crumple zone</a> that will 
                absorb most of the energy in the event of a crash. This is to <a href=" https://snl.no/bilens_sikkerhetssystem" title="Security systems">protect those inside 
                the car</a> instead of the car itself.

                A current concern for many is the dilemma of self-driving cars. Today, car manufacturers like picture2 have much of the technology 
                to use self-driving cars in practice, but due to ethical societal issues, much of this technology is being held back. People 
                also argue that although the technology picture2 has is good, it’s not good enough. There are cases of crashes affected by

                “The person that invented the train invented the train crash”. In theory is this phrase correct: without trains, there will be no train crashes. On the 
                other side you can argue that it’s the person that first used the train wrong that invented train crashes. One can interpret the statement in many ways 
                depending on the individual point of view. We want to further discuss this with another example. The invention of “cookies”.

                Lou Montulli, the inventor of web-cookies, developed the technology to store information on different webpages. When he developed this 
                technology in 1994, we can assume that he didn’t have any intentions that Facebook or Google would use this technology extensively to 
                gather and <a href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org/privacy-concerns/" title="Security concerns regarding cookies">sell personal information</a> of their users. Rather, it was a 
                new use and property of another invention that someone else invented. With that point of view, one cannot say that the inventor of trains 
                also invented train crashes, but that it was rather a consequence of the use of the train. The inventor probably didn’t think about these 
                consequences at all.

                As a developer of a product, you should think about possible dangers or abuses that may be harmful to others or the user. Through this, 
                the developer can reduce or eliminate the possibility of precisely these dangers. On the other hand, it is easy for a developer to overlook 
                a possible negative side effect of the product. Often these problems are only obvious in hindsight.
