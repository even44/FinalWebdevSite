            It’s important that everyone has the ability to use the Web. We strive to make the best 
            version of our website so that everyone has the possibility to use what we have made. 
            The mantra we tell ourself is <q>no barriers</q>, but how will we achieve this? By visualising 
            potential challenges different people will have, we are able to make adjustments to our website that ensures 
            inclusiveness.

            What we did first was to run our website through accessibility evaluation tools. We used 
            <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">Wave</a> and <a href="https://achecker.achecks.ca/checker/index.php">ACheker</a>. 
            In both instances we passed the criteria for the AA-standards. We received feedback from ACheker that we had several 
            potential problems. Considering this, we systematically went through all our code to fix acctual errors this. What was mostly 
            pointed out was that there were some syntax errors that might not be understandable for future developers, such 
            as no correlation between image-name and alt-text.

        <div class="paragraph3">
            <p>
                Before coding anything we made a mindmap of challenges people with different disabilities 
                have. This way we are able to make accessibility choices beyond what Wave and ACheker 
                could provide us. In addition we are also able to add new ideas to the mind map as we 
                discuss problems and solutions.

                Considering visual impairments we were sure to use colors that have a high level of contrast. 
                With <a href="https://webaim.org/">Webaim</a> we were able to test our website. All of our text is black, 
                we had to test how this would work against the color for our navigation-bar (#F3D503), with 
                a contrast level of 14.32 : 1, it would pass for WCAG AAA standards according to webaim. We 
                also had to test black text against white background which we use for the rest of the text. 
                This would also pass the AAA standard with a contrast level of 21 : 1. We also tested our 
                site against color blindness. We also had to test our website for different kinds of 
                colorblindness, we did this using <a href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter/">Toptal</a>. 
                There were no problems with our color choices. We decided to adjust the brightness of the picture of 
                the Tesla on the “Topical” page to make it easier for people with achromatopsia to see.

                We were sure to use fonts that are accessible. By choosing a font that is easy to read, 
                and supported by the most browsers we are able to make the page accessible by those struggling 
                with visual or/and cognitive impairments. 
                According to <a href="https://siteimprove.com/en-us/accessibility/most-accessible-fonts/">Siteimprove</a> 
                the Tahoma font was recommended, this is what we stuck with.

                It was important for us that we include as many people as we could to the best of our ability. 
                Examples of this include motor-, and visual-impairments, cognitive disabilities and motion 
                sensitivity. Please take a look at the mindmap to see the design decisions and changes we have 
                made.
